### Hello! I'm Maureen ðŸ‘‹

I'm a physicist-turned-data scientist who loves working at the intersection of science and technology. Currently based in Seattle, WA, I split my time between working on exciting machine learning projects and exploring everything outdoors in the PNW.


#### ðŸ”­ <b>What I'm currently working on</b>
- Finding the most dangerous intersections for pedestrians and cyclists within Seattle and predicting which ones will see the most collisions and injuries. This is a collaborative project done in conjunction with DataCircles (formerly WiDS). [Read more here](https://github.com/DataCircles)

#### ðŸŒ± <b>What is in the pipeline</b>
- Learning [Google Earth's API](https://earthengine.google.com/) for the purpose of a computer vision project that scans regions of the desert to look for specific phenomena. Feel free to message me if you have any pointers!

#### ðŸ’¬ <b>Ask me about ...</b>
- Manipulation of medical images and dicom files using Pydicom. I've worked extensively with both of these and am happy help! Check out my project on using convolutional neural networks to detect cancer using radiographic images [here](https://github.com/mkpetterson/cancer-prediction).
- Metal-semiconductor interfaces and their role in carbon-nanotube or graphene based photovoltaics. Seriously, it's cool stuff. =)
