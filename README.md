### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a physicist-turned-data scientist who loves working at the intersection of science and technology. Currently based in Seattle, WA, I split my time between working on exciting machine learning projects and exploring the greater PNW.


##### ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on
- Finding the most dangerous intersections for pedestrians and cyclists within Seattle and predicting which ones will see the most collisions and injuries. This is done in conjunction with DataCircles (formerly WiDS). [Read more here](https://github.com/DataCircles)

##### ðŸŒ± What is in the pipeline
- Learning Google Earth's API for the purpose of a computer vision project that scans regions of the desert to look for specific phenomena. Feel free to message me if you have any pointers!

##### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- Manipulation of medical images and dicom files using pydicom. I've worked extensively with both of these and am happy help!
- Metal-semiconductor interfaces and their role in carbon-nanotube or graphene based photovoltaics. Seriously, it's cool stuff. =)
